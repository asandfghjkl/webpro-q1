                &emsp;Ayam Lodho is one of the most popular Tulungagung's local foods. Ayam means chicken and lodho is a way of cooking. 
                Basically twice cooked chicken meat covered in spices and coconut milk until the sauce is thickened.
                It's almost similar to Chicken Curry but with special smoked flavor of the chicken along with super spicy taste and you need to smoke the chicken first.<br>
                The local communities here like to add some 'kencur' or galangal for the curry. Lemongrass, ginger, bay leaf, and turmeric are the most needed ingredients to add the spicy flavor.
                You could find the food almost on every local food .<br>
