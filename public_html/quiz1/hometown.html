                &emsp;Tulungagung back then was only a small area, and the larger one was called <b>Ngrowo</b>.
                Basically Tulungagung means a great water resource in old Javanese language,
                and indeed it was back then and still for now. In the capital of Tulungagung,
                there is Ngrowo River, subpart of Brantas River and it divides the capital of Tulungagung

                &emsp;The northwest part of Tulungagung is a portion of Wilis-Liman mountain range; 
                the central part is lowland; the southern part is portion of rocky Kapur Kidul mountain range

                As for me, Ngunut is where I live this past 21 years plus one week of my life when i write this post^^<br>
                &emsp;Ngunut is located 12km away from the downtown. yes its quite far, but if u think its a rural area and 
                you would find a calm, not a busy area, u're wrong. Ngunut is a busy industrial area. There are plenty industries, 
                from home industries or even big machinery industries. In Ngunut Subdistrict travelers can find knapsack, belt, and traditional fried snack industries. 
                Some of the popular snacks are kacang Shanghai and kacang telor (individual peanut rolled in garlic-seasoned flour batter or egg flour batter)<br>
